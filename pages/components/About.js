          The name Hencove is inspired by a tranquil harbor in Massachusetts
          called Hencove&apos;s Cove. Every brand is on a journey and we are the
          proud co-captains with our clients on their voyage. Based in
          Watertown, Hencove offers both the personal feel of a boutique shop
          and the power of a full-service marketing agency. As a values-based
          agency, we are guided by a set of core principles that influence how
          we think, act and work.
